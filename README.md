# Building JavaScript with JavaScript

[Slides are here](770a6e74318763c51fb663e8b9825e12d7120186).

This repository is the home of the "live" coding portion of the talk. If you look into the log, there are commits relevant to each step in the process (Usually "Implements JavaScript"). I've also added hashtags to the relevant commits, which I'm not even sure is useful, but they're there.

Here the relevant commits in the order they were presented:
